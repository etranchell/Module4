## Description



My motivation to create a quiz page was to show my JavaScipt skills advancing. 
Also to later be able to create a more detailed quiz game for studying.
I build this project to test my JavaScript skills, and to continue practicing coding.
The problem it solves, is creating an easy to study, making studying less difficult.
I learned I still don't know JavaScript very well and I struggled on this.
